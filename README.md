# youtubeservice

Microservice responsible for fetching and sending YouTube LiveChat messages for ByersPlusPlus.

## How to run

Running youtube service alone is easy. Make sure a `clientsecret.json` file exists in the same directory as the binary and run it!

If you want to run it over Docker, you can mount the clientsecret.json file into the root directory.
